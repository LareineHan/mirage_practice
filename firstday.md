Welcome to Console.Blog, where I share my journey of self-discovery and technical advancement. As a mom of two and self-taught designer, I am committed to pushing the boundaries and breaking the barriers that have held me back.

While I may not have a related degree, I have always had a passion for design and technology. Over the past decade, I have honed my skills as a designer, creating promotional materials for clients and bringing their visions to life. But, I have always yearned to take my design to the next level by learning to code.

I am excited to embrace this challenge and document my progress through this blog. Through Console.Blog, I aim to provide an honest and authentic account of my journey, highlighting the challenges and the triumphs, and inspiring others to take on new challenges and pursue their dreams.

As a professional flutist with over 20 years of experience, I understand the importance of practice, dedication, and perseverance. And, I am ready to apply these principles to my pursuit of tech-savviness.

Join me on this exciting adventure, and let's push ourselves to new heights in the ever-evolving world of tech.

This is my first post on my GitHub blog, and to be honest, I'm not really sure how to use it. I've never been good at blogging or tweeting, but I thought it would be a good way to practice my writing skills and document my progress. So, without further ado, here's what I learned today.

Over the past two days, I've been working on freeCodeCamp's JavaScript course and I just finished the first two chapters. The first chapter, Basic JavaScript, was a long but essential chapter for beginners like myself. It covered a lot of ground, from the most basic concepts to some tricky areas that required me to watch videos and do some coding to fully understand. In total, it had 113 topics and quizzes, but I'm glad I finished it because it helped me to go over all the necessary concepts.

Today, I finished the ES6 chapter, which really pushed my knowledge to the next level. However, I realized that I need to spend more time practicing and studying the concept of recursion. In fact, I plan to write a blog post solely on this topic in the future.

One of the things I learned today was about the 'concat' function. I had seen this function in several pseudocodes while searching online, but I wasn't sure what it did exactly. Essentially, 'concat' is a method that combines the inner objects of several arrays. For example, if you have two arrays named babo1 and babo2, you can use the 'concat' method to add the inner values of babo2 to babo1. The resulting array would be babo1 with the added values from babo2.

let babo1 = [1,2,3,4];
let babo2 = [5,6,7,8];

// using the concat() method
babo1 = babo1.concat(babo2); 

console.log(babo1); // [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


However, I also discovered a syntax that does the same thing as the 'concat' method. It's called the rest parameter syntax and it's very simple to use. To add the values of babo2 to babo1 using the rest parameter syntax, all you need to do is write:

let babo1 = [1,2,3,4];
let babo2 = [5,6,7,8];

// using the rest parameter syntax
babo1 = [...babo1, ...babo2];

console.log(babo1); // [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

The rest parameter syntax, denoted by '...', unpacks the rest array and spreads it. It can be used in place of parentheses or brackets, depending on the context. I found this syntax to be very useful and much simpler to write than using the 'concat' method.

That's all for today's post. I hope you found it informative and helpful. I'll be back soon with more updates on my progress.
